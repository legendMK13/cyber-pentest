# Welcome to the Sample Website for Penetration Testing Research!

This repository contains a sample website for penetration testing research, with the goal of finding and documenting security vulnerabilities, and demonstrating proper fixes for them.

## Purpose

The purpose of this sample website is to provide a platform for individuals and organizations to learn about penetration testing and how to properly secure a website from potential security threats. By examining this sample website, individuals will gain hands-on experience in finding and fixing common security vulnerabilities in a web application.

## Key Features

A sample website built with Flask, a popular Python web framework.
Includes common security vulnerabilities found in web applications, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Provides step-by-step explanations and demonstrations of proper fixes for the security vulnerabilities found.
Includes a complete documentation of the security vulnerabilities found and the fixes applied.
How to Contribute

We welcome contributions and suggestions to improve this sample website and its documentation. If you have found a security vulnerability or have a suggestion for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Getting Started

Running the Repository

In order to run the app.py file in this repository, you'll need to have Python and Flask installed on your machine. Here are the steps to get started:

Clone the Repository
Navigate to the repository

### Running the Flask Application

Finally, you can run the Flask application by navigating to the directory where the app.py file is located and running the following command:

``` 
python app.py
```

You should now be able to access the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000/.

## Database Operations

The database used in this project is SQLite. There are several database operations defined in the code that are used to interact with the database:

```
create_database() - This function creates a database connection and creates a table named 'users' if it doesn't already exist. The table has three columns: 'id', 'username', and 'password'.
```

```
add_user(username, password) - This function adds a new user to the database with the provided username and password. It establishes a connection to the database, inserts a new record into the 'users' table with the provided username and password, and then closes the connection.
```

```
get_user(username, password) - This function retrieves a user from the database with the provided username and password. It establishes a connection to the database, retrieves the record from the 'users' table with the matching username and password, and then closes the connection.
```

These database operations are used in the signup and login functions to add new users and retrieve existing users from the database.

## Conclusion

We hope that this sample website for penetration testing research will be a valuable resource for individuals and organizations looking to learn about website security and penetration testing. By examining and fixing the security vulnerabilities in this sample website, individuals will gain hands-on experience in securing their own websites from potential security threats.
